  1. For the terminally lazy
  ==========================

  sudo apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-fcgid
  cp apache-conf/qgis-web-client.conf.tmpl apache-conf/qgis-web-client.conf

Update the paths in the copied file then:

  cd /etc/apache2/sites-available/
  ln -s <path to apache-conf/qgis-web-client.conf> .
  sudo a2enmod rewrite
  sudo a2ensite qgis-web-client.conf
  sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload

1. Check the symlink in cgi-bin is correct.
2. Check the QGIS libs are in your /etc/ld.so.conf path
3. Copy site/index.xml and check paths match your system OR
  Modify index.html and point your browser to that


  2. Purpose
  ==========

A WMS based webgis client that makes use of QGIS specific WMS extensions (e.g.
highlighting, printing, metadata, etc.). QGIS webclient reads the configuration
from the WMS GetCapabilities command and builds the layer tree accordingly.
Supports legend graphic, feature info requests and printing.

The client builds on existing Web-GIS libraries OpenLayers and GeoExt, as well
as ExtJS 3 for the GUI widgets.

All major browsers should be supported.


  3. Installation
  ===============

Requirements (Server):

- Apache2 - Webserver (Ubuntu: apache2)
- mod-fcgid (Ubuntu: libapache2-mod-fcgid)
- QGIS and QGIS Server (best installed from source)

On ubuntu you can meet these requirements by simply doing:

  sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-fcgid

The QGIS server compilation and installation will be covered in the QGIS manual.

For searching:

- python-wsgi for searching (Ubuntu: libapache2-mod-wsgi)
- psycopg2 PostgreSQL db driver (Ubuntu: python-psycopg2)
- webob - Python module providing WSGI request and response objects (Ubuntu:
  python-webob)

The client part needs to be git cloned with the following command:
git clone https://github.com/qgis/qgis-web-client.git


  4. Configuration of Client
  ==========================

Global Settings for all projects (make a copy from one of the templates 
provided):

  site/js/GlobalOptions.js

Translations (additional languages):

  site/js/Translations.js

Project settings and index:

  site/index.xml or site/index.html

Stylesheet of project index:

  site/gis-project_listing.xsl

Thumbnails for individual projects (if you take the index.xml route):

  thumbnails/projectname.png


  4.1. Per Project Startup Options
  ================================

These options are usually defined in the file site/index.xml. The stylesheet then generates
the startup URL parameter options. On the client, the file 'site/js/GetUrlParams.js'
is responsible for the proper handling of the startup options. The following options are available:

  lang

An optional language parameter. Normally, this parameter is defined in the file 'site/js/GlobalOptions.js'.
Optionally this can be overwritten on a per project base. Allowed values are two-character language codes
that must be present in the file 'site/js/Translations.js'.

  visibleLayers

A comma-separated list of layers that should be set visible on the project start.

  format

This optional parameter allows a per project definition of the file format. Valid values are
'image/png', 'image/jpeg' and 'image/png;mode=8bit'. Defaults to 'image/png' if no format is given per project. 
For correct specification of 'image/png;mode=8bit' in a URL please encode it correctly: 'image%2fpng%3b%20mode%3d8bit'.
If you specify this in site/js/GISProjectListing.js you do not need to encode it.

  fullColorLayers

An optional comma-separated list of layers that need to be in full color (24bit). This parameter is only
relevant if the project default image format is set to 'image/png' or 'image/png;mode=8bit'.
If any of the layers in the fullColorLayers parameter list is set visible, the format changes to 'image/jpeg'. 

  maxExtent

The maximum extent of the project. This parameter is used if the 'Full View' navigation button is clicked.
If the 'startExtent' parameter is not specified, 'maxExtent' will also be used as the 'startExtent'.
The format is: left,bottom,right,top in map units.

  startExtent

The initial extent on project load if the project should start with a given, but not the maximum extent
(e.g. for zooming to a specific project area). Not to be confused with the 'maxExtent' parameter.
The format is: left,bottom,right,top in map units.

  searchtables

An optional list of additional search tables specific to the project. The format is 'schemaname.tablename'.
These additional search tables will be used for the search field at the top-right corner of the Webclient-GUI.
The default search tables are hard-coded in the file 'wsgi/search.wsgi', in the 'searchtables' array.


  4.2. Configuration of search panels
  ===================================

There are two types of search panels supported, using a direct WMS
GetFeatureInfo request or using URL rewriting with a much shorter search URL.

The search panels are configured in 'site/js/GlobalOptions.js'. 


    4.2.1. Using WMS GetFeatureInfo
    ===============================

  var simpleWmsSearch = {
    title: "Search continent",
    query: 'simpleWmsSearch',
    useWmsRequest: true,
    queryLayer: "Country",
    formItems: [
      {
        xtype: 'textfield',
        name: 'name',
        fieldLabel: "Name",
        allowBlank: false,
        blankText: "Please enter a name (e.g. 'africa')"
      }
    ],
    gridColumns: [
      {header: 'Name', dataIndex: 'name', menuDisabled: 'true'}
    ],
    selectionLayer: 'Country',
    selectionZoom: 0
  };

- title: title of the search tab
- query: identifier for this search
- useWmsRequest: enabled for WMS GetFeatureInfo request
- queryLayer: name of query layer
- formItems: list of Ext.form.FormPanel item configs
 - xtype: form field type
 - name: name of query layer attribute
 - fieldLabel: visible text for this field
 - blankText: popup text for blank fields
- gridColumns: list of Ext.grid.GridPanel column configs to show search
  results
- selectionLayer: name of layer for marking selected results (the same as
  queryLayer)
- selectionZoom: zoom level for jump-to when selecting results

Request URL:

When performing a search query using the above configuration,
the following get request will be made.

``http://localhost/wms/helloworld?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&
REQUEST=GetFeatureInfo&LAYERS=Country&QUERY_LAYERS=Country&
FEATURE_COUNT=10&INFO_FORMAT=text/xml&SRS=EPSG:4326&
FILTER=Country:"name"+=+'africa'``


    4.2.2. Using URL Rewriting
    ==========================

For security and neatness, you may prefer to use rewritten URLs (so that your
internal server file paths are not revealed. In that case your options file
would contain something like this:

  var urlRewriteSearch = {
    title: "Search letter",
    query: 'samplesearch',
    formItems: [
      {
        xtype: 'hidden',
        name: 'query',
        value: 'samplesearch'
      },
      {
        xtype: 'textfield',
        name: 'colour',
        fieldLabel: "Colour",
        allowBlank: false,
        blankText: "Please enter a colour (e.g. 'orange')"
      }
    ],
    gridColumns: [
      {header: 'PKUID', dataIndex: 'pkuid', menuDisabled: 'true'},
      {header: 'Colour', dataIndex: 'colour', menuDisabled: 'true'}
    ],
    selectionLayer: 'Hello',
    selectionZoom: 1
  };

- title: title of the search tab
- query: identifier for this search
- formItems: list of Ext.form.FormPanel item configs, the query form
  field is required to match the rewrite rule (value is the same as query)
 - xtype: form field type
 - name: name of query layer attribute
 - fieldLabel: visible text for this field
 - blankText: popup text for blank fields
- gridColumns: list of Ext.grid.GridPanel column configs to show search
  results
- selectionLayer: name of layer for marking selected results
- selectionZoom: zoom level for jump-to when selecting results

For every search of this type you have to add a URL rewrite rule in the Apache
config. *Note:* Linebreaks added for formatting - they should be removed in your
config file.

  RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^(?:.*)query=samplesearch&*(?:.*)$
  RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^(?:(?:.*)&)?colour=([^&]*)(?:.*)$
  RewriteRule ^/wms/(.+)$ /cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?map=/
  <path-to-qgis-server-projects>/$1.qgs&SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&
  REQUEST=GetFeatureInfo&LAYERS=Hello&QUERY_LAYERS=Hello&FEATURE_COUNT=20&
  INFO_FORMAT=text/xml&SRS=EPSG:4326&FILTER=Hello:"colour"\ =\ '%1' [PT]


The first RewriteCond matches the query id of the search panel config. The
second RewriteCond extracts the values of the search request parameters.

The RewriteRule composes the actual WMS GetFeatureInfo request to QGIS mapserver.

Request URL:

http://localhost/wms/helloworld?query=samplesearch&colour=orange


    4.2.3. Add search panels to projects
    ====================================

In order for your search panel to appear in the web UI, you must
enumerate them in your GlobalOptions.js for example (with url rewriting):

  var mapSearchPanelConfigs = {
    "helloworld": [simpleWmsSearch, urlRewriteSearch]
  };

Example (no rewriting):

  var mapSearchPanelConfigs = {
    "../projects/helloworld.qgs": [simpleWmsSearch, urlRewriteSearch]
  };

Search panels are added to a project by adding a new key for the map name
with a list of search panel configs to mapSearchPanelConfigs.  If there is
no search panel configuration for a project, the search will be hidden in the
GUI.

The map name is whatever is passed in the get request for your .qgs file. For
example if your url includes this:

  http://localhost/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?map=../projects/helloworld.qgs

then your mapSearchPanelConfigs should reflect ../projects/helloworld.qgs as
the key for the search list.


  4.3. Configuration of the theme switcher
  ========================================

The theme switcher allows to change to a diffent QGIS project (or map theme)
without having to leave the application and using the map extent. To
enable/disable the theme switcher you have to set the variable 

  var mapThemeSwitcherActive = true;

in the site/js/GlobalOptions.js file to true|false. In addition you should
place thumbnail images of your map into the directory site/thumbnails where
the file name equals the projectname. All thumbnails should be 300x200 pixels
in size and in .png format. If you .qgs project is called 'helloworld.qgs' then
your thumbnail should be called 'helloworld.png'.

In addition you need to make entries for topics and projects in the file
'site/js/GISProjectListing.js'. Please use the given file as a template.
The file is in JSON format and starts with a few central parameters.


    4.3.1. Central theme switcher parameters
    ========================================

  path

The 'path' is the URL part used at the start of the application telling the QGIS Webclient where
to find the QGIS projects (see also Apache URL rewriting). This path
may be overwritten in some projects if you password-protect them in a separate Apache location.

  mapserver

This is the path to the WMS server used for WMS requests (e.g. for GetCapabilities, GetFeatureInfo, etc. requests).
Again, this parameter may be overwritten in some projects if you want to password-protect the WMS
in a separate Apache location.

  thumbnails

The URL where QGIS web client can find the project thumbnail images.

  title

The overall title of your Web-GIS. This will be later appended with the name
of your project, separated by a dash. It appears in the title bar of the browser
window and in the title bar of the web application.


    4.3.2. Per topic theme switcher parameters
    ==========================================

You can group your projects into topics. A topic only has a single parameter
with the name of the topic. In a topic element you can have several project
entries in a JSON array called project.

  name

The name of the topic.


    4.3.3. Per project theme switcher parameters
    ============================================

In a topic you can have several project entries. A project can overwrite the global
'path' and 'mapserver' entries.

  name

The name of the project or map. Will be displayed in the theme switcher below the thumbnail and
in the title strings of the application.

  path

Optional. Overrides the central settings in case you need to password-protect certain
projects. The 'path' is the URL part used at the start of the application telling the
QGIS Webclient where to find the QGIS projects (see also Apache URL rewriting).

  mapserver

Optional. Overrides the central settings in case you need to password-protect certain
projects. This is the path to the WMS server used for WMS requests (e.g. for GetCapabilities,
GetFeatureInfo, etc. requests).

  projectpath

The projectpath (directory) or part of the Apache rewrite expression necessary to find
the project file. This parameter is mandatory.

  projectfile

The QGIS project file or part of the Apache rewrite expression necessary to find
the project file. This parameter is mandatory. Depending on the Apache rewrite expression
you may have to omit the .qgis extension.

  format

Optional. The image format that QGIS web client should request. Valid values are: 'image/jpeg',
'image/png' or 'image/png;mode=8bit'. If omitted, the value is taken from site/js/GlobalOptions.js.
If it is not defined there either, the value defaults to 'image/png'.

  visibleLayers

Optional. A comma separated list of layers that should be visible after loading the projects.
A future QGIS Webclient version will also read the layer visibility directly from the GetProjectSettings
command.

  fullColorLayers

Optional. A comma separated list of layers that would trigger a format change from 'image/png' to 'image/jpeg'.
Per defaul, the project would use 'image/png' or 'image/png;mode=8bit' but if the user toggles the visibility 
of a layer with orthophoto data or satellit images, the format will change to 'image/jpeg'.

  updateInterval

Optional. A prosa text indicating how often the project will get data update. E.g. daily, weekly,
monthly, weekly or occasional.

  lastUpdate

Optional. The date of the last data update, e.g. '2012-10-23'.

  responsible

Optional. The organization and/or person responsible for the project
and the data involved.

  startExtent

Optional. The bounding box (left,bottom,right,top in map units) used when starting the project.
If not specified, maxExtent or the extent from the GetProjectSettings is used.

  maxExtent

Optional. The maximum bounding box (left,bottom,right,top in map units) of the project.
If not specified the extent from the GetProjectSettings is used.

  tags

Optional. Tags or keywords displayed in the tooltips in the theme switcher.
The tags are also used in the search filter used in the theme switcher.


  4.4. Extending the interface
  ============================

You can add buttons to implements additional functions (editing, advanced identify, etc.).
See the example in site/js/Customizations.js.

  4.5. Configuration of spatial printing
  ======================================

It is possible to add a polygone-layer in QGIS, which is queried in the Web-Client for spatial related printing-information. You could e.g. add a layer with regional information as name of the region, phone number and other contact details of the responsible administration. To do this, follow-up these steps in QGIS:
1. The layer providing spatial related printing-information has to be named 'print'
2. The polygone-geometry field of the layer has to be named 'geometry'
3. Use the attribute-title of the layer in the print template as 'Item ID' (de: 'Elementkennung')
4. To hide the layer 'print', you could exclude it from the WMS-Capabilities (QGIS: project-settings->ows server-> WMS-Capabilities)
5. The layer has to be published in the WFS-Capabilities

Now the QGIS-client sends the spatial information (attribute-titles of the layer 'print') to the server and there the corresponding item will be filled in when generating a .pdf-document. For the spatial query, the center of the map is being used. 


  5. URL Rewriting
  ================

Using a standard installation of QGIS server, GlobalOptions.js will have a WMS
server configuration like

  var serverAndCGI = "/cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi";

A sample URL for QGIS Web Client installed in /var/www/qgis-web-client:

  http://localhost/qgis-web-client/qgiswebclient.html?map=/opt/geodata/maps/NaturalEarth.qgs&visibleLayers=HYP_50M_SR_W

With the following rules for Apache mod_rewrite you can shorten the URLs to

  var serverAndCGI = "/wms";

and

  http://localhost/maps/NaturalEarth?visibleLayers=HYP_50M_SR_W

Rules in VirtualHost configuration:

  # Forbid direct access
  RewriteRule ^/cgi-bin/.*$ - [F]
  
  # Search with SearchPanel (e.g. Address)
  RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^(?:.*)query=address&*(?:.*)$
  RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^(?:(?:.*)&)?street=([^&]*)(?:(?:.*)&)+number=([^&]*)(?:.*)$
  RewriteRule ^/wms/(.+)$ /cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?map=/opt/geodata/maps/$1.qgs&SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&REQUEST=GetFeatureInfo&LAYERS=addresses&QUERY_LAYERS=addresses&FEATURE_COUNT=10&INFO_FORMAT=text/xml&SRS=EPSG:21781&FILTER=addresses:"street"\ =\ '%1' AND "number"\ =\ %2 [PT]
  
  # Rewrite /wms/mapname to qgis_mapserv.fcgi?map=mappath/mapname.qgs
  RewriteRule ^/wms/(.+)$ /cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?map=/opt/geodata/maps/$1.qgs [QSA,PT]
  # Rewrite /maps/mapname to qgis-web-client main page. mapname will be extracted for wms calls in Javascript code.
  RewriteRule ^/maps/([^\.]+)$ /qgis-web-client/site/qgiswebclient.html [PT]
  # Rewrite /maps/* to qgis-web-client/site (e.g. /maps/gis_icons/mActionZoomNext.png -> /qgis-web-client/site/gis_icons/mActionZoomNext.png)
  RewriteRule ^/maps/(.*) /qgis-web-client/site/$1 [PT]

For supporting qgs files in subdirectories (e.g. /maps/subdir/mapnampe) replace last rule with:

  RewriteRule ^/maps/[^/]+/(.*) /qgis-web-client/site/$1 [PT]

For adding zones in different subdirecories (e.g. maps and maps-protected) add the following rules:

  RewriteRule ^/wms-protected/(.+)$ /cgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?map=/opt/geodata/maps-protected/$1.qgs [QSA,PT]
  RewriteRule ^/maps-protected/([^\.]+)$ /qgis-web-client/site/qgiswebclient.html [PT]
  RewriteRule ^/maps-protected/(.*) /qgis-web-client/site/$1 [PT]


  6. Configuration of search python script
  ========================================

Searching is handled by two separate python-wsgi scripts: "search.wsgi" lists
back a hit list while the user is typing in the searchbox. It groups the
results and returns a bounding box of the result. "getSearchGeom.wsgi" returns
the actual wkt geometry for a selected search result. It is recommended to
install the wsgi scripts in a separate directory, e.g. /home/www/wsgi, a place
that is not reachable by regular web traffic.


  6.1. Configuration of mod_wsgi
  ==============================

You need to enable mod_wsgi as root. (Ubuntu: a2enmod mod_wsgi).

You need to configure apache with the following lines (e.g. in file
/etc/apache2/sites-available/default):

  #mod_wsgi
  WSGIDaemonProcess gis processes=5 threads=15 display-name=%{GROUP}
  WSGIScriptAlias /wsgi/ /home/www/wsgi/
  WSGIScriptAliasMatch ^/wsgi/([^/]+) /home/www/wsgi/$1.wsgi


  6.2. Adaption of the wsgi scripts to your settings and needs
  ============================================================


    6.2.1. DB connection
    ====================

In the files "search.wsgi" and "getSearchGeom.wsgi" please edit the line
containing the db connection strings. Search for the line 

  conn = psycopg2.connect("host='yourhost' dbname='yourdb' port='5432' user='yourusername' password='yourpassword'")

and adapt the parameters according to your server/db. It is highly recommended to
connect with a database user having limited rights only (e.g. select rights on relevant tables only).


    6.2.2. Search type to be used
    =============================

The search can use PostgreSQL's tsvector data type. 
"A tsvector value is a sorted list of distinct lexemes, which are words that have been normalized to
merge different variants of the same word."
from the PostgreSQL doc (http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/interactive/datatype-textsearch.html#DATATYPE-TSVECTOR).
Thus tsvector skips all the fill words and reduces nouns to their single form, a behaviour useful
for searching texts. However as we are normally dealing with place names here we want them to stay as they are.
If you use a language where the single form is a lot different from the plural form but your name contains a plural
you will not get a suitable result. If you want to use the tsvector search option you should activate the lines

  sql += "searchstring_tsvector @@ to_tsquery(\'not_your_language\', %s)"
  data += (querystrings[j]+":*",)

not_your_language is to be replaced with an entry e.g. finnish if you have German place names.
Thus plural forms and fillwords are kept as they are. Be aware of side effects!
Be sure to fill the field searchstring_tsvector with `to_tsvector('not_your_language', 'yourstring')`.

The use of

  sql += "searchstring::tsvector @@ lower(%s)::tsquery"
  data += (querystrings[j]+":*",)

is discouraged as it does not find a place name like Stoke-sub-Hamden when you enter Stoke.

If you do not want to use tsvector at all you can enable the full string comparison on the field searchstring
(activated by default).

  sql += "searchstring ILIKE %s"
  data += ("%" + querystrings[j] + "%",)

This method however is slower than tsvector but not relevantly at least if you only have a couple 1000 datasets. 


  7. PostgreSQL table setup for searching
  =======================================

  CREATE TABLE cadastre.searchtable
  (
    searchstring text, --the search string (all lower case), e.g. "zürichstrasse 46, 8610 uster"
    displaytext text NOT NULL, --the display text for the search combobox, e.g. "Zürichstrasse 46, 8610 Uster (address)"
    search_category text, --should have a leading two digit number:, e.g.
                          --"03_parcels", where 03 is the order of the search categories, the number
                          --should be unique across all search tables
    the_geom geometry,    --the actual geometry
    geometry_type text,   --the geometry type as returned by ST_GeometryType(the_geom)
    searchstring_tsvector tsvector, -- be sure to fill this with to_tsvector()
    CONSTRAINT searchtable_pkey PRIMARY KEY (displaytext)
  )
  WITH (
    OIDS=FALSE
  );
  GRANT SELECT ON TABLE cadastre.searchtable TO qwc_user;
  
  -- Index: cadastre.in_cadastre_searchstring_tsvector_gin
  
  CREATE INDEX in_cadastre_searchstring_tsvector_gin
    ON cadastre.searchtable
    USING gin
    (searchstring_tsvector);

The above search table can also be a view or materialized view. One can combine
several search tables by specifying the `searchtables=searchtable1,searchtable_n` 
parameter when requesting the search.wsgi script. Any searchtable passed to search.wsgi may only contain
the letters A to Z, a to z and the underscore. Double quoting the search table throws an error, thus searchtables' names must
contain lower characters only.

Using views is generally slower than properly indexed tables, check for yourself what works best.


  8. Configuration of search PHP script
  =====================================

As an alternative to python-wsgi scripts, a set of PHP scripts is available
under php folder. PHP scripts are similar in scope to python-wsgi scripts
but should require less configuration and should work out of the box 
with just a few lines of configuration. The DB table structure must not be altered
in order to use PHP search scripts.


  8.1. Differences with python-wsi scripts
  ========================================

The main difference is that there are no hardcoded values and much less
configuration is needed because all needed informations are read from
the project file.

Another notable difference is that layer names are used instead of
table names, this in order to not disclose internal DB details.


  8.2. Available scripts
  ======================


    8.2.1. Search
    =============

The "search.php" scripts works in the same way as the "search.wsgi" (see the paragraph above).
Accepted parameters:

- map (map name or path)
- query (search text)
- searchtables (optional: layer names to search in)

The companion "search_geom.php" has the same role of the wsgi script "getSearchGeom.wsgi".

- map (map name or path)
- searchtable (layer name)
- displaytext (the matched string)


    8.2.2. Unique list
    ==================

This simple script returns the unique values of a given column of a given PostgreSQL layer.
Accepted parameters:

- map (map name or path)
- layer (layer name)
- field (column name)

The script returns a json array of unique values and can be useful to implement select combo boxes for the search panels.


    8.2.3. Get legend
    =================

This script has no wsgi counterpart, it works with recent QGIS Server versions (2.0.1 and newer) and can be used to build a template-based HTML legend instead of the image provided by GetLegendGraphic calls.

To use this feature you must activate it in GlobalOptions.js, search for the commented line below:

  var interactiveLegendGetLegendURL = '../php/get_legend.php?map=' + project_map + '&';

Legends generated by this script can be cached for speed, see the paragraph on configuration below.

Accepted parameters:

- map (map name or path)
- layer (layer name)


  8.3. The configuration file
  ===========================

Configuration for the services is stored in  `config.php`.

Example:

  /****************************
   * Map rewrite configuration
   */
  // Prefix map name with path
  #define('MAP_PATH_REWRITE', '/home/xxx/public_html/QGIS-Web-Client/projects/');
  // Append .qgs to the map name
  #define('MAP_PATH_APPEND_QGS', true);
  
  
  /**************************************
   * search configuration
   */
  // Configuration for searchable layers
  $searchlayers_config = array(
      // Key is layer name
      'Country' => array(
          // SQL for text search: where to search
          'search_column' => 'name'
      )
  );
  
  // Default search tables
  define('DEFAULT_SEARCH_LAYERS', 'Country');
  // Limit search results
  define('SEARCH_LIMIT', 100);
  
  
  /**************************************
   *  Get legend configuration

QGIS Web Client needs to know where to find the scripts, since most
configuration is read from the project file, this must be passed in the
query string, the file where this parameters are set is
GlobalOptions.js see the example below:

  // Adds project_map, read value from query string
  var project_map = Ext.urlDecode(window.location.search.substring(1)).map;
  
  var searchBoxQueryURL = '../php/search.php?map=' + project_map;
  var searchBoxGetGeomURL = '../php/search_geom.php?map=' + project_map;
